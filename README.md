# Fedex technical assessment
- a display of my (full) Stack capabilities: Application Logic, pipelines, automated-testing. From A to Z. 

due to time constrains, nice to haves:
- tests are written on a really basic/general level, would have loved to be able to have spent way more time on that, the power of automated testing for an Engineer, in the perspective of TDD, is highly underestimated
- RegEx patterns shared over Micro Service with FE
- thorough userId validation on log out
- working with JWT, Passpoort, Session for user authentication / management
- check if user already exists on create, etc..
 
## Backend Stack
- NestJS
- MongoDB (AWS)
- GitHub (CI/CD pipeline)
- deploy to Heroku (dev, master)
- Jest unit / API testing
